### Section 1: Jon

Problem: What is the existing testing problem that this technique/tool is
intended to help with? Do not assume the reader has prior knowledge of the

### Section 2: Anish

Previous approach: How was this problem handled (that is, how was the testing
done) prior to this advanced technique/tool?

### Section 3: Nik

Approach taken by this advanced technique/tool: How does it work? Explain,
with examples, what it does, clearly and in your own words.

### Section 4: Nik

Your Evaluation of it: How good is this advanced technique/tool? What are the

### Section 5: All

References: Include the paper(s) that you read describing the advanced testing
technique you're reporting on and/or the websites where the advanced tool
