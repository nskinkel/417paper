# Requirements

In the second meeting, you will have to make a 20-minute presentation with
slides and satisfying all of the following 9 requirements, simultaneously:

1. All team members have to present something.

2. No information about the project should be assumed known to the audience.

3. The presentation will clearly state the scope of the project (try to explain this coherently, in simple terms -- main ideas and intuition behind them).

4. The presentation will clearly state the current design (block diagrams, pictures, etc. should be included). If you believe this is the weak point of your project, you will have to work hard demonstrate some design component.

5. The presentation will clearly state how you have reached the current design (explain the process of design) and how the project progressed so far.

6. The presentation will point out from 2 to 5 technical challenges you have encountered during the project design and/or implementation, and the brilliant solutions you found to overcome these challenges. Please do not include all the challenges in the same place in your presentation -- rather, distribute them throughout.

7. The presentation will show the existence of a coherent test plan which was (or still is) carried out. This will demonstrate that you approached the problem in a systematic manner.

8. You must show that you have thought of all possible scenarios when producing the design, and that you have prepared for all the unexpected scenarios by designing a good testing and debugging plan.

9. The presentation will have a clear story line (narrative), and should flow well. Try to make connections between different phases of the presentation, so that the transitions are smooth.

10. The presentation should include one or several short embedded videos of your demo (please get creative). This should not exceed 3 minutes.


Try to stick to light-colored backgrounds (light colored backgrounds look better on large screens -- like the projector you will use during the final IRP presentation, so try to stick to that starting now.) Make sure your presentation has enough contrast (no yellow writing on white background).


For this second meeting, you will have to present using your own machine (please do not bring me memory sticks).
